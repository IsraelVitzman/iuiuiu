          Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.

          We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
          creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
          creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
          that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network

            Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital
            currency system that is dependent on growing and engaging with the
            community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total
            value of the tokens minted.

          <p id="text2">
            Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to
            benefits including unreleased content, private communities, direct
            access to celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well as
            the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access
            to more creator content with early token buyers being the biggest
            winners as the value of the token increases with more buyers.
