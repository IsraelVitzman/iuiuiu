          We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
          creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
          creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
          that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network

          <p id="text1" >
            Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital
            currency system that is dependent on growing and engaging with the
            community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total
            value of the tokens minted.
